## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Run The App

Run this command on your terminal: `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### What I learned

In this challenge, I have learned how can I work with useEffect and useRef which are the features that are available in react that help us to work with sideeffects(fetching data from api and eventlisteners) and selecting the dom elements in react. I have also implemented a custom hook which is called useFetch which handles all the fetch logic which I have used throughout all the components. this custom hook avoids repeated code which I have used for the fetch api purpose.

### Continued development

For the future, I want to build project by using react and do js challenges.
